// An option for the chief: allow/prevent secret mating.  DONE
// commands should work with names OR @names
// secret mating (outside the channel)  asynchronous mating.  Announce pregnancy at end of repro round; pregnant women can mate more the turn they concieve. !consent takes an arg
// losing a turn includes missing a repro round
// injury should block mating; maybe isInjury = 3, decrement by 1 at start of every round?
// give should be case insensitive
// Have adult kids automatically drop their babysitting when the babysittee grows up
// referee force a player to do a work
// people with spaces and special characters in the names
// Alex Popiel(male) should now !invite people to reproduce, or !pass  use @Alex Popiel#0145 syntax, so that the target player get's a notification that he's up.
