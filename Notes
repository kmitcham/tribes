WIP

2025 01 11 Saturday
looking at join, I think I added correct archive stuff

So it has been a long time.
work round->food round-> reproduction round

So I think I have join.  Do I have init?

++ I need to resolve the git issues with github
Maybe github needs a password protected key?  
<pwd>-git

01-18 Saturday
Work on init  Nope. not needed; incorporated into the bot.

So join seems busted
Typo in genders, seems resolved now.

Now I need a chief.  Vote?
++ history seems to have doubled messages?

Poking along into reproduction round, foodcheck seems OK

?? sockpuppet has no handle or id message?  It doesn't have an handle.it, but it does have a handle.userid
Hmm.  I can harass sockpuppet  You harass sockpuppet420_73735

So no clue what was wrong, but I duplicated the Id and userId, and that seemed to work.
Add consent and decline, and managed a repro round


Failed on getting the unit tests to work.
So looking at the simple test over in ping, the API change will probably have broken all the command tests.
Still, the library tests should be doable.

-- force jerky to integers
-- endgame
-- gather double message?
-- scorechildren
-- all of conflict
-- can guard pregnant child?  ACtually, that is a feature
-- reproduction lists are busted, !save is not respected on update after reproduction round
-- male got pregnant?  DONE

-- message lib: messageTribe(bot, gamestate, message); messageMember(bot, gamestate, memberName, message) sendMessages(bot, gameState)
    ONLY called by commands, not libs.
    libs add items to 'messages' dict in gamestate, {'tribe':'message for tribe', 'member1':'private message to member 1'}
-- migrate.js and migrateLib.js have a better seperation of responsibilities using message lib.
-- scout nerd is broken
-- canCraft not set on a crafter?
-- reproduction messaging may be in trouble, since it is triggered from so many places  SEEMS FINE

-- unit test on migrateLib.js
-- unit test on feed lib
-- score game report male and female scores, sorted (for winners)
-- sockpuppet didn't get mating messages?
-- chance result 5, sickness, check food?  NEEDs ref unless someone saves them.
-- long messages get split between channel and DMs, not obvious
-- faction for/against/neutral isn't working
-- section titles to help page
-- deal with servernames  DONE?
-- changes to romance during reproduction aren't saved correctly
-- child died on migration after a feed !all. (the child was unborn, and didn't get fed by feed !all) they were listed in the check though
++ without a referee, the 2 food penalty for an injury hard to apply when they have no food (but the tribe might help them)
++ double used a spearhead; gave after a hunt
++ history removed from reproduction, hunting.  Probably gathering
-- child died on migration after a feed !all. (the child was unborn, and didn't get fed by feed !all) they were listed in the check though
++ endgame needs to check banished and graveyard
++ NOTE FOR KEVIN: I can tap on arguments types like “destination” but not on the choices like “marsh”. This makes me sad @kevinmitcham .
++ history isn't working?
++ feed !all when no children need food is weird.

	console.log("user is:"+interaction.member);
	userId = interaction.member.id;
	var elephant = interaction.member;  << this has 'nickname' field >>
	const rhino = client.users.cache.get(userId);  << this does NOT have nickname >>

So I have a function to get the nickname, but it reqiures the client.
BUT... if I capture the nickName at join/induct, I can add it to the member object.
then population can look for them that way.
So how does that interact with targeting?  
so trying to fix how to null out reproduction lists.
distracted since I broke migrate test
++ did I fix names with spaces in reproduction?  Add to unit test
++ check nicknames in join and induct; add unit tests
++ confirm showHistory works after banished or dead.

Come test my Tribes server!

Tribes is a game with simple mechanics but really cool emergent properties that come from the players' interactions.
I've implemented a program on a Discord server to handle the rules and inventory system, freeing the players to spend their time and attention on each other.

I'm looking for playtesters to play a few sessions of a few hours each to help smooth the documentation and game flow and to shake out the remaining bugs before I open it to the general public.
Please contact me at kmitcham@gmail.com or just dive in at https://discord.gg/m2nTTnUEQx if you want to try it.
Most players will be able to read the help text and get started without any handholding, but I'm around most evenings after 6 Seattle time for questions.

Tribes is best with 4-6 players, but as few as 2 can succeed.
While players with no Tribes experience are the intended audience, Tribes experience is a plus for understanding what is a bug and what is rules-based suffering. When in doubt, mention it.
I am interested in feedback on the help text, command descriptions, rules implementations, and of course bugs.

I realize that Discord isn't the best environment to do this, but until someone wants to team up to work on a cooler, stand-alone tool, this is what we have.

SENT!
