# 🏛️ Tribes Game - WebSocket Edition

A modernized version of the Tribes Discord bot, converted to a web-based interface using WebSockets. This project transforms the original Discord-based game into a standalone web application that can be run locally or deployed via Docker.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

1. **Build the container:**
   ```bash
   ./build-docker.sh
   ```

2. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   ./run-docker.sh
   ```

3. **Access the game:**
   - Local: http://localhost:8088
   - Network: http://[YOUR-IP]:8088 (run `./setup-network.sh` to get your network URL)
   - Health Check: http://localhost:8088/health

### Option 2: Development Mode

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   ./run-dev.sh
   ```

3. **Access the game:**
   - Game Interface: http://localhost:8088
   - Health Check: http://localhost:8088/health

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Open the web interface** at http://localhost:8088
2. **Select your tribe** from the dropdown (Bear, Flounder, Bug, etc.)
3. **Enter your player name** and optional password
4. **Register/Login** by clicking the "Register/Login" button
5. **Browse available commands** in the left sidebar, organized by category
6. **Select a command** to see its parameters and description
7. **Fill in parameters** and click "Execute Command"
8. **View game data** in the tabs (Population, Children, Game Status)

## � Network Access (Multiplayer)

To allow others on your local network to join the game:

1. **Get your network setup info:**
   ```bash
   ./setup-network.sh
   ```

2. **Share the network URL** with friends on the same WiFi/network:
   - They visit: `http://YOUR-IP:8088` (script will show the exact URL)
   - Each player registers with their own name
   - Everyone can join the same tribes and play together

3. **Requirements:**
   - All players must be on the same local network (WiFi/Ethernet)
   - Firewall must allow connections on port 8088
   - Server computer must keep running the tribes server

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Test with: `curl http://YOUR-IP:8088/health`
   - Check firewall settings on host computer
   - Ensure all devices are connected to the same network

- **User Authentication:** Basic user registration and login system

### Web Interface (`tribes-interface.html`)
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive interface with tabbed layout
- **Command Browser:** Categorized command list with descriptions
- **Dynamic Forms:** Auto-generated parameter forms based on command definitions
- **Real-time Updates:** Live game data updates via WebSocket
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error messaging and connection status

### Docker Support

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Commands

1. Create command file in appropriate `commands/` subdirectory
2. Follow Discord.js command structure with `data` and `execute` exports
3. Server will automatically load and expose the command via WebSocket

### Modifying the Interface

- Edit `tribes-interface.html` for UI changes
- Commands and parameters are dynamically generated
- WebSocket protocol is documented in server code comments

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## 🐳 Docker Management

### View Logs
```bash
docker logs -f tribes-server
```

### Stop Server
```bash
docker stop tribes-server
```

### Restart Server
```bash
docker restart tribes-server
```

### Remove Container
```bash
docker stop tribes-server
docker rm tribes-server
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 8088)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode (development/production)

### Data Persistence
Game data is stored in JSON files:
- `users.json` - Player accounts
- `[tribe-name]-tribe/` - Tribe-specific game data

## 🌐 Network Requirements

- **Port 8088** - Main server (WebSocket + HTTP)
- **Outbound Internet** - For npm package installation during build

## 🔄 Migration from Discord

This version maintains full compatibility with the original Discord bot logic:

- All commands retain their original parameters and behavior
- Game state files are compatible between versions
- Users can migrate existing games by copying tribe data files

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check if port 8088 is available
- Verify firewall settings
- Try accessing http://localhost:8088/health

### Docker Issues
- Ensure Docker is running
- Check available disk space
- Try rebuilding with `./build-docker.sh`

### Game Data Issues
- Check file permissions in tribe directories
- Verify JSON file integrity
- Check server logs for detailed errors
